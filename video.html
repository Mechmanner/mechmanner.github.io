    <p>To make your videos look good set the settings so everything is high quality, but you do have 60 fps gameplay for the video making purpouses. I have a pc that is good enough for shaders, but don't overdo it. If everything looks drasticly different it can remove from the video. I personally have miniature shader on low and a cloud mod.</p>

    <p>Another thing that you have to focus on is the thumbnail. You really want to make sure it stands out from the other thumbnails. You can even use other thumbnails for reference when making your own!</p>
