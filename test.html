      <p>Hello! So you are interested in my videos or just want to see how i make them? Becouse that is what this website is for! I have different pages for all youtube playlists, and a page for the developement of my videos!</p>
      <p>Okay, so the first things i want to share is the things that i do before the video. Like the timeline of the video. <a href="before" target="_top" style="color:grey; font-family:verdana;"> You can find that here!</a></p> 
      <br>
      <p>Another great way to keep people watching your videos: is the audio. If your audio is not that interesting, or really bland it's genneraly a bad watch and people are more incentivized to click on the other thumbnail on the left. <a href="audio" target="_top" style="color:grey; font-family:verdana;"> I explain that here.</a> </p>
      <br>
      <p>And of course: the video. It has to look good for people to watch longer. <a href="video" target="_top" style="color:grey; font-family:verdana;"> I talk about that here.</a></p>
      <br>
      <p> And then the thing i have the most to talk about: The edditing of your videos. <a href="edditing" target="_top" style="color:grey; font-family:verdana;"> That is very important.</a></p>
