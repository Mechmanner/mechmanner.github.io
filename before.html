    <br><br><br>
    <p>before you make a video you need to determine what you want to make a video on. This could be obvious, but you need to be more specific than you think. Are you gonna make minecraft videos? Okay, what are you gonna do in minecraft? is it worth waching that? Would you be interested if you saw this? If not: you could add something that is different like a challenge, or make the videos in a way that is different than other videos!</p>
