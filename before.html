    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Before the video starts.</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>before you make a video you need to determine what you want to make a video on. This could be obvious, but you need to be more specific than you think. Are you gonna make minecraft videos? Okay, what are you gonna do in minecraft? is it worth watching that? Would you be interested if you saw this? If not: you could add something that is different like a challenge, or make the videos in a way that is different than other videos!</p>

    <p>I don't script everything in my videos. That is probably obvious, but i like the genuine reactions more. What i do use is a timeline. Before i start i evaluate what i want to do in the video. So it is not just: lets make a survival video, but it is: A survival video where i first make a villager breeder, then mine for diamonds, then get a mace and maybe a trident, and finally beat the enderdragon and get an elytra. This is important so you can allude at what you are going to do later so you can hook the watcher more easily.</p>
